# Logistic Regression from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of **binary logistic regression** from scratch, applied to solve several classification problems. The primary objective is to explore both linearly separable and non-linearly separable datasets using logistic regression.

## Features

- **Binary Logistic Regression Implementation**: A complete implementation from first principles.
- **Classification Problems**: 
  - **Linearly Separable Classes**: Addressed with basic logistic regression.
  - **Non-Linear Decision Boundary**: Handled using polynomial transformation followed by logistic regression.
- **Iterative Optimization Methods**: 
  - **Gradient Descent**
  - **Mini Batch Gradient Descent**
- **Learning Curves Analysis**: Evaluation of the learning curves for both linear and non-linear cases.
- **Decision Boundary Visualization**: Visual representation of decision boundaries (limited to two features for clarity).
- **Performance Evaluation**: 
  - Various classification performance metrics on the test set.
- **Loss Surface Visualization**: Examination of the loss surface and the optimization paths taken by each iterative method.
