# Logistic_Regression_from_scratch

- I implement **binary logistic regression** from scratch and employ it for solving a couple of classification problems.
- In one of the setting, we have linearly separable classes and the other one has non-linear decision boundary between classes.
- The first problem could be addressed with basic logistic regression classifier, while the second requires additional step of **polynomial transformation** before using Logistic Regression.
- I also analyze the learning curves of individual models of iterative optimization, i.e. Gradient Descent, Mini Batch Gradient Descent for both the linear and non-linear cases.
- I also visualize the decision boundaries, since we limit ourselves to only 2 features.
- I also evaluate their performance on the test set via various classification performance metrics.
- Finally I visualize the loss surface and see the paths taken by each of the iterative optimization model separately.
