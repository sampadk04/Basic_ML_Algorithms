# Perceptrons_from_scratch

- I implement the perceptron classifier from scratch.
- I look at 3 different cases and analyze those using our model:
    - First, for linearly separable data.
    - Second, for linearly inseparable data (with approximate linear boundary fit).
    - Third, for non-linearly separable data.
- I also look at the learning curves and analyze the loss.
- Finally, I visualize the decision boundary obtained by the model in each instance.
