# Perceptrons from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of the perceptron classifier from scratch, along with an analysis of its performance on various types of data. The project explores three different cases:

1. **Linearly Separable Data**: Data that can be perfectly separated by a linear boundary.
2. **Linearly Inseparable Data**: Data that cannot be perfectly separated by a linear boundary, but an approximate fit is attempted.
3. **Non-Linearly Separable Data**: Data that cannot be separated by a linear boundary at all.

## Features

- **Implementation**: A custom-built perceptron classifier.
- **Analysis**: Detailed examination of the model's performance on different datasets.
- **Learning Curves**: Visualization of the learning process and analysis of the loss over time.
- **Decision Boundaries**: Visual representation of the decision boundaries for each dataset type.
